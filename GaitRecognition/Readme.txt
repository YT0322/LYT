In this report, I have accomplished the following:

1、Reproduced the code from the GaitSet paper.
2、Explored the GaitSet network architecture.
3、Attempted to apply the Swin-Transformer to the field of gait recognition.
Due to space limitations, I have uploaded the processed dataset and complete code to Google Cloud Drive.
